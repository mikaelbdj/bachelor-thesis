# Bachelor-thesis

## Two algorithms for SCC analysis
- One fast in practice, but slow in theory
- One slow in practice, but fast in theory

## Describe the two algorithms
## Implement the two algorithms in choice of programming language
## Compare them wrt.
- No. of steps
- with different BDD implementations
- etc.

## Suggest improvements in the algorithms (?)

## Conclude which parts make difference between theory and practice
