\subsection{The JavaBDD library}
An early decision was made to use the JavaBDD library when implementing the algorithms. \cite{whaley}

\subsection{The bddgraph framework}
Before going into the implementation of the algorithms themselves, it is necessary to establish a code foundation that allows us to do the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Generate a BDD representing a graph, given some conventional graph representation (adjacencylists or edge list).
\item Given a BDD representing a set of nodes, easily compute the image and pre-image of a BDD representing a graph.
\item Pick a BDD representing a node from a BDD representing a graph.
\end{itemize}

With these requirements in mind the code base that can be seen on Figure \ref{main_uml} has been developed. The \texttt{BddGraph} class acts as a wrapper for two \texttt{javabdd.BDD} (from now on BDD) objects: representing nodes and edges respectively. In short, the purpose of the class is to provide an 'api' for programming the symbollic graph algorithms - by providing the nice functions described above. The \texttt{BddGraph} class makes use of some internal classes that are useful abstractions for traditional edges (\texttt{Edge.java}) and for binary numbers (\texttt{Binary.java}).\\

The symbollic algorithms for computing SCC all implement the interface \texttt{GraphSCCAlgorithm}. The sole method in this interface is a method run, that takes a \texttt{BddGraph} object and returns a Set of BDDs. Each BDD represents a set of nodes, so this returned value is exactly the set of SCCs. This interface serves as an abstraction for the algorithm caller - they should not care about the implementation of the run method; just that it returns the SCCs of the graph they provide.

\subsection{Lockstep}
With the framework described above in place, implementation of the lockstep algorithm was fairly simple and without much hassle. The code itself can be seen in \todo{(refer to appendix)}

Slight optimizations has been made from the version described in the pseudocode in \cite{lockstep}. In their pseudocode (page 45) lines 29-34, they only really extend one frontier while the other one is empty. Instead of calling img/preimg on empty sets, we simply just check which set has converged and only extend the other frontier. Other than this small change, everything is done according to the pseudocode provided. 

\subsubsection*{Trimming}
One thing mentioned in \cite{lockstep} is that the algorithm can be slightly optimized even more by trimming the set $P$. Trimming refers to removing singleton SCCs; this is done in every call to lockstep. These are of course added to the set of SCCs before being removed. We have also implemented this variant as we believe it would be interesting to compare it to the original while testing.
