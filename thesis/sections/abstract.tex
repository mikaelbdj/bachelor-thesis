\begin{abstract}
We present two frequently used algorithms for strongly connected component decomposition. which in the worst case perform $\mathcal{O}(n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ image and preimage computations, where $n$ represents the number of nodes in the graph. We suggest improvements to the algorithm, to lower the number of computations performed. These two algorithms and their improved versions were then compared in terms of the number of computations performed and runtime to find the best algorithm.
