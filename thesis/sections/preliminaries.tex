\todo[inline]{include symbolic operators here?}

This section dsicusses the notions used in the two algorithms we will be focusing on. For the following definitons, let $G=(V,E)$ be a directed graph.

In this thesis, we are dealing with symbolic algorithms for strongly connected component analysis. A strongly connected component (SCC) is a maximal set of nodes $C\in V$ such that $\forall v,w\in C$, there is a path from $v$ to $w$. Symbolic algorithms manipulate sets of nodes by using symbolic operators. For a directed graph G and $S\subseteq V$, we can derive the following operators: 
\begin{align*}
\img S &= \set{v' \in V}{\exists v\in S:(v, v')\in E}{|}\\
\pre S &= \set{v' \in V}{\exists v\in S:(v', v)\in E}{|}
\end{align*}

The image and preimage operations will be refered to as ``steps'', and the complexity of the algorithms will be measured in terms of these steps.
From these operators, we can derive the notion of forward and backward sets, which will be key elements in the algorithms.

A forward set, \FW{S}, is the set of nodes that can be reached from $S$. Similarily, a backward set, \BW{S}, is a set if all the nodes that reach $S$. These can be expressed formally as the least fixpoint of respectively $\lambda S.\{v\}\cup \text{img}(S)$ and $\lambda S.\{v\}\cup \text{preimg}(S)$. Using mu-calculus \cite{clarke_peled_grumberg_1999} this can be expressed as 
\begin{align}\label{fw}
\FW{S} &= \mu S.\{v\}\cup \text{img}(S)\\
\label{bw}\BW{S} &= \mu S.\{v\}\cup \text{preimg}(S)
\end{align}

The authors \cite{linear} introduce a notion of a skeleton and a spine-set. A skeleton of a forward set of the vertex $v$ \FW{v} is \pair{S}{v}, iff the distance from $v$ to $u$ is maximum and $S$ is the set of nodes on the shortest path between the two vertices.

A spine-set in turn is a symbolic way of ordering sets of nodes. A spine-set is a subset \pair{S}{v} of G, for which it contains a chordless path for the set $S$ ending in $v$.

If \FW{v} is the forward-set of $v \in V$, and if the skeleton of this forward set is \pair{S}{u}, then it is also a spine-set in G. We will be making use of this in the linear-time algorithm when computing the spine-set, which is part of the input.
