** Purpose
- Compute set of nodes that have a path to a fair cycle (SCC)
- Used to check Büchi emptiness 
 
** Terminology
- Büchi automata: ((V, E), V_0, F) and all (L,U) in F, L = V

** Pseudo code
#+BEGIN_SRC python
Y = V
prevY = Ø
while Y != prevY
	prevY = Y
	result = Ø
	for (L,U) in acc_cond
		predecessors = U intersect Y	
		prev = Ø
		while predecessors != prev 
			prev = predecessors
			predecessors = predecessors union preimg(predecessors)
	
		predecessors' = preimg(predecessors)
		result = result intersect predecessors'	
	Y = result
return Y

*** Textual description of pseudo code
Find a largest set Y such that the inner loop does not change it. The inner loop, for each U in acceptance sets: computes all nodes that can reach Y intersected with U and then elimates nodes not in cycles by taking preimage. These sets are intersected and stored in a result. Y is assigned to this result in the end.
